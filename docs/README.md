# Docs

This repo currently maintains three doc tracks:

## Rails rewrite integration docs

These are app/rewrite implementation notes:
- `docs/rewrite/README.md`

## Research / case study docs (shareable)

These are reliability-focused write-ups for `TavernKit::VibeTavern`:
- `docs/research/vibe_tavern/README.md`

## Product TODO / backlog docs

These are future product notes (deferred work that will be iterated later):
- `docs/todo/README.md`
